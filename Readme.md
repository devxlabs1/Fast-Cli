### üåü Quick Start 

1. **Install Fast:** Follow the [installation instructions](#installation) above to get started.
   
2. **Get Started:** Create your new extension project with:

   ```bash
   fast create <extension-name>
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   fast create example
   ```

   Next, fill in the required parameters:
   - **Package Name:** `com.yourcompany`
   - **Author Name:** `your Name`
   
3. **Edit Your Project:** After the project is created, navigate to `your-project/src/your-name/extension-name/extension.java` and edit it according to your needs.

4. **Build Your Extension:** Run the following command to build your extension:

   ```bash
   fast build
   ```

**Important Note:** If you're using Java 8, it won't compile by default. You will need to enable `desugar_sources` by setting it to `true` in `your-extension-directory/fast.yml` (it‚Äôs set to `false` by default).

5. **Add Dependencies:** If you're using any dependencies, make sure to include them in your `fast.yml`.

6. **Compile Again:** After making these changes, compile your project again.
